 <h1>
 A New Zealand city is taking its official <span class="noun">wizard</span> off the payroll after over 2 decades  
</h1>

       
        <p> Christchurch, New Zealand, is parting ways with its official city <span class="noun">wizard</span> after more than two decades. His offensive remarks about women and the local government's <span class="adj">new</span> tourism strategy reportedly spelled his doom.</p>

        <p>Ian Brackenbury Channell is known as The <span class="noun">wizard</span> of New Zealand, apparently even on official documents like his passport. He's been on the Christchurch City Council's payroll since 1998, receiving an annual salary of $16,000 NZ (more than $11,000 in current USD) to "provide acts of wizardry and other wizard-like-services – as part of promotional work for the city of Christchurch," according to the New Zealand news site Stuff.</p>
        
        <p>But that job title will soon become — like many <span class="noun">wizard</span>s before him — a thing of legend.</p>
        
        <p> "The <span class="noun">council</span> has met with The Wizard and sent him a letter thanking him for his services to Christchurch over the past decades, and informing him that we are bringing our <span class="adj">formal</span> contractual arrangement to a close," said Lynn McClelland, the council's assistant chief executive. She <span class="verb">said</span> the final payment will be made in December.</p>

        <p> Channell told Stuff that the <span class="noun">council</span> had waved him off because he didn't fit with the city's <span class="adj">modern</span> image, calling them "a bunch of bureaucrats who have no imagination" and are "not thinking of ways to promote Christchurch overseas." </p>

        <p>Despite his disappointment, Channell promised to keep visiting Christchurch's Arts Centre to <span class="verb">chat</span> with tourists and locals. "It makes no difference. I will still keep going," he <span class="verb">said</span>. "They will have to <span class="verb">love</span> me to stop me."</p>

        Some of the career highlights chronicled on the wizard's website include: performing rain dances in New Zealand and Australia during droughts, participating in protests against the demolition of heritage buildings after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes and famously battling the company Telecom over the changing color of the city's telephone boxes in 1988.

        <p>He went around <span class="verb">repainting</span> the <span class="adj">new</span> blue boxes to their original red, according to one biography, in a battle that "raged for twelve days" and at one point even involved the city council.</p>

        <p>The ongoing exhibition about his life says it includes major sections on"his <span class="adj">miraculous</span> rain dances, ingenious avoidance of the Census, the hilarious war with Telecom over the change of colour of their phone boxes, the spells cast for the Canterbury Crusaders, the unusual candidates who between 1972 and 1990, stood for the Imperial British Conservative Party in Australia and NZ, the Wizard's part in the narrowly won battle to save the earthquake damaged Cathedral from being bulldozed, the mythical implications of the Queens Service Medal awarded to a Wizard." </p>
